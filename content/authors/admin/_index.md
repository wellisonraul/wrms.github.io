I am a third-year PhD student in Computer Science at [UFPE](https://www.ufpe.br/), advised by Prof. [Nelson Rosa](https://www.cin.ufpe.br/~nsr/) and Prof. [George Cavalcanti](https://darmiton.com/). I am affiliated with the [GFADS Research Group](https://sites.google.com/a/cin.ufpe.br/gfads/) at the [Centro de Infórmatica](https://portal.cin.ufpe.br/).  I am broadly interested in distributed systems and machine learning areas. My current research focuses on developing proactive self-adaptive systems using time series forecasting to maintain/improve microservices' performance.  I am also spending a semester as a visiting student at the University of British Columbia, where I am researching at the Systopia Lab advised by Prof. [Thomas Pasquier](https://tfjmp.org/).
